Hi ---,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Nicholas Lam, and I am currently in my third year at Ivey business school, completing a dual degree with computer science. I'm interested in hearing about your experiences at ---.

In terms of my background, I spent my first year summer interning at Relay Financial as a data analyst and spent my last summer shadowing a professor at Ivey, in the creation of a faculty database of North American universities.

If you're willing, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn more about your experiences through a call. I am more than happy to work around your schedule.

Best regards,

Nick
